# 📌 F1 Predictor

## Overview
An F1 World Drivers’ Championship (WDC) prediction model that combines **driver form, qualifying pace, track history, reliability, and championship standings** into a statistical framework. Predictions are simulated using **Monte Carlo methods** to generate both race-level and season-level outcomes.

## ⚙️ Methods & Formulas

### 1. Rolling Form (Driver Momentum)
```
RollingForm_d = ( Σ (0.75)^(n-1-i) * Points_{d,i} ) / ( Σ (0.75)^(n-1-i) )
```
Scaled 0–100 by dividing by 25 (max FIA points).  
**Why**: Recent races matter more. Prevents rookies (e.g., Piastri) from being unfairly penalized by lack of long history.

---

### 2. Qualifying Gap to Pole
```
GapToPole_d = t_d_best – t_pole_best
```
**Why**: Direct raw measure of car + driver pace, less noisy than race results.

---

### 3. Pace Score
Grid-position exponential decay:  
- P1 = 100  
- Score halves every *k* positions (half-life ~ 7).  

**Why**: Captures that small differences at the front matter more, while backmarkers converge.

---

### 4. Track Performance Score
Custom scoring table (1st=40, 2nd=35, 3rd=28 … 20th=1) averaged per track.  
**Why**: Encodes historical driver–track skill without overweighting midfield consistency.

---

### 5. DNF Chance
```
P(DNF_{d,track}) = DNFs_{d,track} / Starts_{d,track}
```
**Why**: Introduces reliability risk into predictions. Defaults to 0 if no history.

---

### 6. Driver Score → Win Probability
```
Score_d = a·RollingForm + b·Pace + c·TrackScore + d·Survival + e·ChampRating
```
Converted with **softmax** (temperature-scaled) → win probabilities.  
**Why**: Softmax allows all drivers to have >0 chances, while *temperature* controls uncertainty (higher temp = more randomness, lower temp = sharper prediction).

---

### 7. Monte Carlo Simulations
- **Race Simulator**: Plackett–Luce / Gumbel-Max sampling. 1M runs → probability distribution of finishing positions.  
- **Season Simulator**: 10M runs → aggregates per-driver expected points → predicted championship standings.  

**Why**: Models the stochastic nature of races & randomness in outcomes.

## ▶️ Running Order

1. **fastf1.py** → process raw data → `Data_Processed/fastf1/`  
2. **rolling_form.py** → generate rolling form, DNF chance, pace scores → saved under `driver_stats_over_years/`  
3. **quali_feat.py** → build quali features  
4. **predictor_with_quali_results.py** → compute race-level predictions after quali  
5. **remaining_race_simulator.py** → run Monte Carlo sims → WDC predictions in `wdc_prediction/`

---

## 🚀 How It Works
- **Input**: Raw FIA race + quali timing data (2018–2025).  
- **Processing**: Extract features (form, pace, track history, reliability).  
- **Prediction**: Weighted driver strength → win probability.  
- **Simulation**: Monte Carlo → race distributions → season outcome.
